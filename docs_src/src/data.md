# Data preparation

This is the most important step in machine learning, and performance of your
model totally depends on it. Some general tips includes:

- Cleaning your data set from suspicious and wrong data
- Feature engineering and giving more hints to the model
- Normalizing and scaling input data
- Randomizing input data order

There is definitely more to that list, and it's strongly recommended to spend
more time on studying and preparation of input data than selection and tweaking
of the machine learning method. [pandas] and [scikit-learn] are your best
friends for data preparation if you are familiar with [Python] programming
language.
